#Wanda
This is a Leap Motion based sound visualizer that one can cast spells to generates sound and visual effects by changing gestures like the Scarlet Witch Wanda Maximoff. The initial commit is a basic leap motion framework wired up to the OpenFrameworks. Future commits will use leap motion to track hand movements and palm/finger directions to cast different spells.

Run instructions:  
1. Install Leap Motion V2 Desktop SDK at https://developer.leapmotion.com  
2. In Xcode, run Wanda.xcodeproj and compile
