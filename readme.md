This is a Leap Motion based sound visualizer that one can cast spells to generates sound and visual effects by changing gestures like the Scarlet Witch Wanda Maximoff. The initial commit is a basic leap motion framework wired up to the OpenFrameworks. Future commits will use leap motion to track hand movements and palm/finger directions to cast different spells.
